# Designing and ordering the PCB.
For designing schematic and PCB, I am going to use easyeda, a online platform to design PCB.
you could use any-other software if you want.
first of all we need to design the schematic for our project.
if you want it to able to be soldered with the SMT services you must use the components from the LCSC assembly category and the components must have the SMT icon in order to be used with the soldering process, otherwise they won't have that components ready for the dispensing machine.
Before you make your PCB, I recommend you to go to this link and see the all the details for their services please read all the capabilities and frequent ask question and then according to the capabilities make your PCB design.

Now you have to convert this schematic into PCB and place all the components one side of PCB
either top side or bottom, In my case all the components are placed on the top side of the PCB, so they all can be soldered.
Now go to jlcpcb website and select quote now button under SMT assembly service,
First as always upload the Gerber file, Once the upload is complete you can see the PCB design. Now select the PCB quantity and color masking of PCB.
Scroll down this page and enable the SMT assembly option.
You will be asked on which side you want the SMT assembly because jlcpcb assembled only one side of the PCB either top or bottom side.
In my case I want SMT assembly on the top side of PCB, so select that and click on confirm.
Now this will takes on the next page and here we have to upload two more files that is BOM (bill of material) and pick and place file,
These file we have already downloaded from the easyeda where we had design the PCB now upload these files one by one. after that click on next button.

On the next page we will get the list with all the components that we want to solder on the PCB.
After confirming all the components click on next button.
On the next page a virtual view of all the SMD Components and pricing or cost SMT assembly along with all details.

After checking all these details click on save to cart to complete the order.

# Unboxing and first look on the PCB Quality.
I have received the PCB at my place with in a week, lets start with quick unbox and see the quality of PCBs, if the components are well soldered, if the packaging is okay stuff like that.
PCBs are well wrapped in a bubble wrap and not just that but also the some foam inside and some more layers of wraps, damaging during shipping is almost impossible.
We have a layer of bubble wrap between each PCBs so that's pretty cool for the packaging.

I think it is quite okay so let's see the next step.
I have the PCBs We can take a first look and at first sight, I can see any problem they look pretty perfect.

And as you can see all the components are on the top side and we don't have anything on the bottom Side and that's very important because for now the SMT service from Jlcpcb only accepts for you to use just only one side for SMD solder you can choose either of the sides Either of the layers but you can only select one of the layers.

So if you have more components for example you have more components on the bottom side they won't solder for you so you have to do that manually when you receive the boards.

In my case I solder all the components on the top side.
All the components are well soldered and they are the correct components, and also the solder is well placed as you can see resistor, transistor they put just little bit of solder and the connection is great and also on the esp32 chip each pin is well soldered and tracks are also perfect

and look great and the silk layer is also pretty good, overall we have a very good quality of PCB everything is well placed and well soldered.
Now lets talk about pricing and cost of manufacturing I got 5 assembled PCBs in just $69, for me this price range is pretty ok, because esp32 chip is little costly.

So in this way approximately I got per PCB in $14 which is great deal for me.
So you can also tryout JLCPCB SMT services for your project in a very affordable cost.

and apart from this JLCPCB also gives lots of coupons for SMT services.

So in this way JLCPCB provides Low Price and Fast delivery which saves your money and time.
